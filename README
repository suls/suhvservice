SuhvService
===========

Rails-Plugin for accessing the SUHV web service.


Example
=======

See example/ directory. Before running the examples you need to
generate the file ~/.suhv_id as follows:

    suhv_id = { :dev_id => , :dev_code => ""}
    File.open(ENV["HOME"]+"/.suhv_id", "w") { |file| YAML.dump(suhv_id, file) }

That's it!
